# RNAseq_with_Hisat2_stringtie
RNAseq analysis with Hisat2, stringtie, and ballgown

This will go through RNAseq analysis from building the Hisat2 reference to mapping with Hisat2, creating transcripts with stringtie and comparing between samples.

Then I will detail using ballgown in R to extract DE genes, creating data outputs and investigating transcripts
